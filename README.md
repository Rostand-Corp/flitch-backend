# Flitch

The backend part of the Flitch application

## Status

We are currently on the stage, where user can register/authenticate in the application,  
confirm his email, change his password in two ways. Users can now also create chats  
(private, group) with any other user and leave their lovely messages in there. Messages  
can also be altered and deleted. You can also change your status and nickname, search users.
